# Groovy List Summation Issue with Mixed Data Types

This example demonstrates a common error in Groovy when calculating the sum of a list containing a mix of numbers and strings.  Both the built-in `sum()` method and a manual summation loop fail due to type mismatch issues.

The `bug.groovy` file shows the problem.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a solution using type checking and conversion.
